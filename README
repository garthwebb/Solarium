About the Art
-------------

The Solarium is an art project for Burning Man 2011.  It is a domed structure about 8' in diameter and 8' tall with space inside for approximately 6 people.  The inside of the dome will be lined with color LEDs spaced every 5" which will simulate a sunrise and sunset once every 9 minutes throughout the night.  During the day solar panels will recharge a set of deep cycle batteries that power the project.

About the Hardware
------------------

The code for this project is written in C and compiled for the Marvellâ„¢ PXA270 microprocessor.  This is the processor for the Gumstix Verdex Pro (http://www.gumstix.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=209) that will run the Solarium.

The code will communicate with the light controller devices via the I2C serial interface.  The devices are NXPs PCA9635 (http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9635.pdf).  There are 108 devices split into groups of three to control red, green or blue LEDs.  Each group of three is mounted on a PCB called a "Ray" (as in "ray of light").  Since each device can control 16 single LEDs, the Ray as a whole can control 16 RGB LEDs.  There will be 36 Rays.
